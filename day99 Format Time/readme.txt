Date Time Class Format is used to display date and time and manipulate date and time in java and in addition to this it is also used for formatting date and time class in java across time zone associated data. So in order to import this class from a package called ‘java.utils’. After importing this class one can create an object of the Date class in order to print the current date and time. Now in order to print the default date and time simply call the print command using toString() method to get the current date and time.

Milliseconds if computed through inbuilt data class function call from any time in the code base reference is set as 1 Jan 1970. In order to print no of milliseconds till now simply use getTime() instead of to String() to get no of milliseconds till now. Suppose if the user wants a particular date, time, and month from the current time. This can be done by the Date and SimpleDateFormat classes of the java.
