LinearSearch(array, key)
  for each item in the array
    if item == value
      return its index
    
    How Linear Search Works?
The following steps are followed to search for an element k = 1 in the list below.
      2 4 0 1 9
     
  1.Start from the first element, compare k with each element x.
        2 4 0 1 9
        
  2.If x == k, return the index
  
  
  
  Linear Search Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Linear Search Applications
For searching operations in smaller arrays (<100 items)
