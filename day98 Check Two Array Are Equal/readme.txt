Given two given arrays of equal length, the task is to find if given arrays are equal or not. Two arrays are said to be equal 
if both of them contain the same set of elements and in the same order. 

Note: If there are repetitions, then counts of repeated elements should be the same for two arrays to be equal.

Examples:

Input  : arr1[] = {1, 2, 5, 4, 0};
         arr2[] = {1, 2, 5, 4, 0}; 
Output : Yes

Input  : arr1[] = {1, 2, 5, 4, 0, 2};
         arr2[] = {2, 4, 5, 0}; 
Output : No
 
Input : arr1[] = {1, 7, 7};
        arr2[] = {7, 7, 1};
Output : No
