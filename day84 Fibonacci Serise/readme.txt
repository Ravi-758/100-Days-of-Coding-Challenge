The Fibonacci series is a series where the next term is the sum of the previous two terms. The first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence are 0 followed by 1.

Fibonacci Series: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34

Suppose, our first two terms are:
Suppose, our first two terms are:

firstTerm =  0
secondTerm = 1
The next terms in the Fibonacci series would be calculated as:

nextTerm = firstTerm + secondTerm; (0 + 1)
firstTerm = secondTerm; (1)
secondTerm = nextTerm; (1)

nextTerm = firstTerm + secondTerm; (1 + 1)
....
Let's now apply this logic in our program.
